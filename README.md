School Osmosis lab result analysis via Linear Regression

#there are two scripts, one of them doesn't contain a ggplot so it can be implemented on school chromebook's Rstudiocloud.
##work in progress

Conclusions of the lab: 
The isotonic point of sweet potatoes in approx. 1.295M
the isotonic point of regular potatoes is approx 0.5M

The trend for sweet potatoes is that as concentration increases, the mass/water absorbed increases 
THe trend for potateos is that is taht as concentration increases, the mass/Water absorbed decreases
